## Who am I?
Welcome to my Blog, my name is Ryan Beckett. I hope to share with you through this blog a little about me and my experiences as I develop from a student, to a full-fledged software engineer. As a disclaimer all posts are based on my own views.

I am student software engineer currently living in Belfast, Northern Ireland with a passion for mobile development.
Most of my days are spent studying for a Bachelors in Software Engineering at [Ulster University][Ulster], Jordanstown.

One of my favorite things todo are hackathons. They always bring about an incredible atmosphere, which in turn brings about a positive energy in everyone. This is a really good motivator for the 'hack', and a great motivator after the 'hack'. It's also a great way of learning as you get a chance to play with new technologies that you may not have access to and/or the experience to use. It allows experience to be passed on from one developer to another and most importantly, you build something cool as a team.

## Why the blog?
Possibly the most important thing in this post. Why have I decided to blog?
I would like to spend my time blogging and hopefully soon contributing to open source projects on Github as I feel an ethical obligation. Free and open collaboration on the web is the foundation of my own knowledge; and to contribute back to this would hopefully then allow the same, if not better opportunities that I have been fortunate enough to have over the past two years to someone else.

Thanks for reading!
