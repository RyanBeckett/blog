Welcome to my Blog, my name is Ryan Beckett. I hope to share with you through this blog a little about me and my experiences as I develop from a student, to a full-fledged software engineer. As a disclaimer all posts are based on my own views.

####Who am I?
I am student software engineer currently living in Belfast, Northern Ireland with a passion for mobile development.
Most of my days are spent studying for a Bachelors in Software Engineering at [Ulster University][Ulster], Jordanstown. Outside of computing I enjoy a range of things. Such as anything fitness related, longboarding and spending time on beaches.

Hackathon's are another infatuation of mine, there are a few reasons for this. Thereâ€™s always an incredible atmosphere. This really brings about this positive energy in everyone which is a really good motivator for the 'hack', and a great motivator after the 'hack'. They are a fantastic way of learning as you get a chance to play with new technologies that you may not have access to; they also allow experience to passed on from one to another. This really touches on core area of Software engineering. This is a really engaging way to learn as it's practical.

Now that's a little about myself. If you would like to know more please read the [About me][aboutme] page

####Why?
Possibly the most important thing in this post. Why have I decided to blog?
I would like to spend my time blogging and (hopefully) soon contributing to open source projects on Github as I feel an ethical obligation. Free and open collaboration on the web is the foundation of my own knowledge; and to contribute back to this would hopefully then allow the same, if not better opportunities that I have been fortunate enough to have over the past two years to someone else.
