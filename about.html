            <h4>More About Me.</h4>

            <p>I am student software engineer currently living in Belfast,
              Northern Ireland with a passion for mobile development.
              Most of my days are spent studying for a Bachelors in Software Engineering at <a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Ulster University </a>, Jordanstown.
            </p>

            <p>During my first year of studies for my Bachelors in Software Engineering I worked part time at <a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Kainos Software</a>
              as part of their R&D Team. During my time with Kainos Software I learnt a lot about the importance of 'softer skills'
              that are required to be a Software Engineer E.g. Teamwork and the good communication required with that,
              Patience, Strategic thinking and a business acumen to name a few.</p>

            <p>I have taken part and also been involved in the teaching of the <a href="https://codecamp.kainos.com/" target="_blank">Kainos CodeCamp</a> scheme.
              This scheme aimed to teach 17-19 year olds how to create Android applications using MIT AppInventor.
              The camp was a great success, with the students not only learning new programming skills,
              but getting first hand experience in key subjects such as UX design,
              iOS application development and source control. Article <a href="https://codecamp.kainos.com/meet-mentor/" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>During the summer of 2014 I volunteered as a Test Engineer Intern for <a href="http://www.theappbuilder.com/" target="_blank">TheAppBuilder</a>.
              I worked as part of a small team performing testing procedures on
              mobile applications and ensuring that all errors were identified and
              corrected before release to clients.
