### About Me
I am software engineer currently living in Belfast, Northern Ireland with a passion for mobile development. Most of my days are spent studying for a Bachelors in Software Engineering at [Ulster University](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/) while working at [Kainos](https://www.kainos.com/) as a member of their R&D team.

I have been involved in the [CodeCamp](http://codecamp.kainos.com/) scheme. This scheme aimed to teach 17-19 year olds how to create Android applications using MIT AppInventor. The camp was a great success, with the students not only learning new programming skills, but getting first hand experience in key subjects such as UX design, iOS application development and source control.
